Ataraxc Blockchain Technologies (open-source)

<h1>Welcome to Ataraxc Blockchain Technologies</h1> This is a cryptocurrency project aimed at providing large-scale investing authority to everyone. Our goal is to reduce volatility in the cryptocurrency space and provide a platform that allows all members to enjoy financial success. The project consists of a native token called the King Token (ARXX)
with a total token supply of three million and a circulating supply of one single token.


Additionally, there is a self-replicating DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) comprised of 500,000 members. Membership is obtained through the purchase of an NFT linked to the King Token. When the DAO reaches 500,000 members, a new DAO is created, and the process is replicated infinitely.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To get started with the Ataraxc DAO, you will need to purchase an NFT certificate on Opensea through the Ataraxc Blockchain Technologies collection. Other iterations of the collection are added periodically.


The King Token entire supply is listed under ARXX Fund private tag on Etherscan. Currently it is an unverified contract. As community support increases we will release the final version appropriately.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
We welcome contributions to the ARXX Fund, as all contributions go towards advancing a better blockchain ecosystem. If you are interested in contributing, please find our ARXX Fund on etherscan.

We are looking for developers, designers, and community managers to help us build and grow the project. Please review our contribution guidelines before submitting a pull request.
