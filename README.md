<h1>Welcome To The Ataraxc Project!</h1> This is a cryptocurrency project aimed at providing large-scale investing authority to everyone. Our goal is to reduce volatility in the cryptocurrency space and provide a platform that allows all members to enjoy financial success. The project consists of a token called the King Token (ARXX)
with a total token supply of three million and a circulating supply of one single token.

Additionally, there is a self-replicating DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) comprised of 500,000 members. Membership is obtained through the purchase of an NFT linked to the King Token. When the DAO reaches 500,000 members, a new DAO is created, and the process is replicated infinitely.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To get started with the Ataraxc project, you will need to download and install a compatible cryptocurrency wallet. We recommend using a wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens such as MetaMask.

Once you have your wallet set up, you can purchase King Tokens (ARXX) on supported cryptocurrency exchanges. You can use these tokens to purchase an NFT linked to the King Token and become a member of the Ataraxc DAO.
